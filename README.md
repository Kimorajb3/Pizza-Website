For this project, you will be creating an entire App from scratch.

An Order Processing Person Should be able to:
I.	Login 
II.	View a list of orders that need to be fulfilled
III.	Change the state of an order from Open to Ready to Delivered/Picked-up

You will need to complete this Project as a Team.  You will need to start from scratch, that is no database is provided, no code is provided.  You should probably start with an OOAD(Object Oriented Analysis & Design).  And go from there.

The Instructor will act as your Client, that is the Person that you will deliver your software to.  You can ask specific questions of the Client(Instructor) to guide you in your project design and coding.

Project Requirements: 

PART I: Analysis and Design (60 Points)
Before you begin Coding, sit down and plan out your project.  What Business Objects will you need?  Design your Database, and all parts of your Project.

PART II: Software Delivered (360 Points) Create and test extensively all the pieces of this application.  

PART III: Documentation (60 Points) Create Documentation for Software.  I would create both Object Documentation, for future software developers that will add/modify this software, and a User’s Guide so that users of this software can learn how to use this software.

Peer Evaluations:

After your Team’s Presentation, each Team Member will be asked to evaluate the other team members.  These evaluations will be totaled up as part of your Final Course Grade. (175 Points)

Instructor’s Evaluation:

After your Team’s Presentation, the instructor will also evaluate your contributions to the Project.  This evaluation will also count as part of your Final Course Grade. (175 Points)


Getting Credit for your Project:

Do no print your code.  Near the end of the Semester, you and your team will create a Video to Present your Software to your Instructor. (75 Points)

When is the Project Due? 

The Videos will be DUE during the last week of the Semester.
